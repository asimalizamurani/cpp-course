// Operators Challenges
/*
  1. Arithmetic Operators
Challenge: Create a program that calculates the total price of tea cups. The user inputs the number of cups they want and the price per cup. The program should calculate the total price, apply a 5% discount if the total is above a certain amount, and show the final price.

*/

/* 2: Assignment Operators

Challenge: Write a program that allows a user to input the number of tea bags they have. Assign additional bags to them based on certain conditions (e.g., if they have fewer than 10 bags, give them 5 extra). Update the original number using assignment operators.
+=, -=, *=, /=, %= 
*/

/* 4: Logical Operators

/* 4: Relational Operators

Challenge: A teashop offers a loyalty program. Customers who buy more than 20 cups of tea get a special "Gold" badge, and those who buy 10 to 20 cups get a "Silver" badge. Write a program to display the badge they will receive based on the number of cups they buy.

Write a program that calculates the price of tea packs. A user enters the number of tea packs they want, and the price per pack. Apply a 10% tax to the total price and display the final cost.
 */

 /* 
2. Challenge 2: Assignment Operators

   If the number is less than 20, give them 10 extra bags using hte `+=` assignment operator. Display the updated total.
 */

 /* 
3. Challenge 3: Relational and logical Operators
   A tea subscription service offers a discount if the user buys more than 12 cups or if they are a member for more than a year. Write a program that checks if the user qualifies for a discount based on their input.

 */

 /* 
2. If-Else Statement
Challenge: Write a program that checks if a tea shop is open. If the current hour (input by the user) is between 8 AM and 6 PM, the shop is open; otherwise, it's closed.
 */

 /* 
3. Nested If-Else

Challenge: A tea shop offers discounts based on the number of tea cups ordered. Write a program that checks the number of cups orderd and applies a discount: More than 20 cups: 20% discount
    -> Between 10 and 20 cups: 10% discount
    -> Less than 10 cups: No discount
 */

 /*
